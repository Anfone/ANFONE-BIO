	    &nbsp<h2>Hello i'm Rosalie Layaguin Anfone and I was born on June 5, 2003 <br>
		in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/LoregaSanMiguel">Lorega Cebu City</a><br>
		I was raise in Lapu-Lapu City <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=214834090900549&set=a.214834054233886">(Home Care Center)</a><br>
		so many things happened during my years in elementary school. <br>
		And yet, so much of it has been blurred <br>
		in my mind or erased completely from my memory. <br>
	    However, i'll never forget my first day of school <br> 
	    in elementary at lapu-lapu city central <br>
		i remember being excited ,because i will meet a new friend in the class. <br>
		As a student, I wasn't always the brightest, <br>
		and I don't think I want to be either. <br>
		When I was in elementary school, I wanted to know everything there was <br>
		to know about every subject my teachers had taught me. <br>
		I believe I did well since I never experienced any class disruptions. <br>
		When I had less than a year left in my six years of elementary school.</h2>
